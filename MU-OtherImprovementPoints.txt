1) view_child_part_view_by_filter - Supplier part - > when changing UOM it select the default one and not the selected one
2) Supplier and Inhouse -> Saftey stock, stock location and rate can all these be per unit ?
3) Supplier page UI label changes - remove Supplier from most of the fields. Same on View list 
4) child_part_supplier_view : Performance 
	- Changes for retaining the selection from and back button etc.
5) No back button from view PO
6) pending_po - performance
7) Expired PO:
		When we land on this page then only we are updating the po as expired if the date is in past.
		check expired_po.php
		
		UPDATE `new_po` SET `status` = 'expired'
		WHERE `id` = '30'
		AND `clientId` = '1'
8) Rejected PO - what is the definition of this ? Looks like it is pending po with expired date only i.e. same as that of expired PO.
9) Other than pending PO - all places should not have select part dropdown and add qty section as it is using more space there.
10) SubCon PO list  - like Supplier list/ Pending/ expired/closed - all code and pages are same with regular PO so there should be differentiation.
